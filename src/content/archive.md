# Archive

Despite the brief time spanned, the history of the Internet is both complex and multifaceted.  The Internet Legacy Archive is loosely organized into five overlapping eras: the ARPANET, CSNET and BITNET, the NSFNET and Regional Networks, Commercialization, and Advanced R&D Networks.  But along the way there are many, many other equally important histories, such as the internationalization of the Internet.

While a more complete taxonomy of the Internetâ€™s evolution is still emerging, modern searching tools make it possible to find relevant information in the original source documents.  Accordingly, as materials are processed they are being made available online with appropriate search tools.

The archive currently contains over a hundred hours of audio and video interviews which will be made available on this website over the next few months.  The archive has also begun collection of many historical documents, such as records from the Federation of American Research Networks.  These too will be made available over the next few months.
